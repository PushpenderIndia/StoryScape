## Problem Statement
- Nowadays students face problem due to `low attention span` which is less than a gold fish.
    - Gold fish attention span: `9 sec`
    - Humans attention span: `8 sec`

- Also, It is `very hard to spread awareness` about topics which are considered
`‚Äútaboo‚Äù` in our society such as `periods`, `superstations`, `sex education`, etc.

- As per studies conducted in `US by NCBI`, suggested that approx. `65%` of the
population are `visual learners`, So learning from textual content leads to
    - Difficulty in Conceptualization
    - Reduced Retention
    - Limited Engagement
    - Difficulty in Problem-Solving
    - Limited Creativity and Expression
    - Increased Cognitive Load

## Our Solution
- Our idea is to build Gen AI powered platform, which will `convert boring textual content or taboo topics` to visually appealing `comics/manga`.

- User can `specify plot` & `characters` of the storyline `or just enter a topic` and it will generate a comic book as per their `comic style` i.e. `Marvel`, `DC`, `Disney Princess`, `Anime` etc.

- Our platform will utilize `text-to-image transformations` using `Stable
Diffusion`.

- We will optimize the pipeline to `generate a comic under 30-50 secs` using `Multithreading` & `Caching database (Redis)`.

## Features Offered
- [X] Generate in your favourite comic style i.e. Marvel, DC, etc
- [X] Ability to set custom characters and story plot
- [X] Generate Shareable comic link or share comic pdf
- [X] Enhances user experience with realistic animations simulating page turning
and book opening/closing, creating an immersive digital reading
environment.
- [X] Ability to create vernacular(Hindi/English/Tamil/etc) comics

 5. [Comics-Scenes-Generator üí¨ü§ñ](#Comics-Scenes-Generator)

<a name="Comics-Dialogue-Generator"></a>
## Comics-Dialogue-Generator üìù

- This code snippet demonstrates the utilization of Intel Neural-Chat Text Generation model, leveraging a pretrained model from Hugging Face. 
- Facilitating the generation of comic dialogues based on textual prompts. 
- For Creating High quality comic scene images, we are Generating dynamic image prompts for specifying minute details about the comic scenes, these dynamic image prompts are created using neuralchat by supplying comic scene dialogue.
- By loading the model onto the available device along with our custom post processing code, the script efficiently processes the input prompt and produces comic dialogues in a Json format. 
- Notably, running this code in **Google Colab** takes lots of time, but leveraging **Intel's CPU** or **XPU** helps us reduce the generation time in few seconds. üöÄ
- We have used NeuralChat (which is a Intel Mistral 7B Optimised model) for its blazing fast speed and high accuracy

## Comics-Scenes-Generator üë§üöÄ

- This code implements an image generation model using Stable Diffusion optimised by IPEX and Intel OpenAPI run on Intel Developer Cloud (IDC). 
- The model is designed to generate visually appealing comic scenes. 
- The Intel Developers Cloud XPUs helped in reducing the time of inference, and the optimized PyTorch for Intel Hardwares helped us in reducing the overall time for comic scene generation. üåêüñºÔ∏èü§ñüí™

# Usage of oneAPI and Intel Developer Cloud üåêüíª
Utilizing the resources provided by Intel Developer Cloud significantly expedited our AI model development and deployment processes. Specifically, we harnessed the power of Intel's CPU and XPU to accelerate two critical components of our project: Comics Dialogues Generation and Comic Scenes Generation. üíª‚ö°

1.  **Neural Chat:** fine-tuned by Intel 7B parameter LLM on the Intel Gaudi 2 processor from the mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 and run on `intel_extension_for_transformers` performed exceptionally well compared to other tested models of the same family - Mistral 7B

>Comparison between time took in Intel Developers Cloud using IPEX and Kaggle
    
In summary, leveraging Intel Developer Cloud's advanced CPU and XPU technologies, using their Intel Extension For Pytorch (IPEX) and their Intel Extension For Transformers significantly accelerated our model and inference time and project's development. üöÄüïí

# Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è    
1.  **Backend - Flask:** Our application's backend was constructed using Flask, a versatile Python web framework. Flask facilitated the development of RESTful APIs, user authentication, data processing, and integration with machine learning models efficiently and swiftly. üêçüöÄ

3.  **Machine Learning Models:** Our app utilizes advanced machine learning models developed with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers for intelligent features like comics dialogue and scene generation with custom characters. ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è
    -   **Image Generation** - [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/Intel/stable-diffusion-65e0914ce1349d31319a9ef0)
    -   **Text Generation** - [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/Intel/intel-neural-chat-65b3d2f2d0ba0a801668ef2c)
4. **Intel Xeon Processors with AMX**: To accelerate AI operations, especially matrix-heavy computations, ensuring efficient model training and inference.
5. **Intel OpenVINO Toolkit**: For model optimization and faster inference, enabling real-time comic generation.
6. **Red Hat OpenShift AI**: A cloud-native platform to deploy and scale our solution seamlessly.
5.  **Other Technologies:** In addition to React, Flask, and machine learning models, our application utilizes a range of other technologies to enhance performance, security, and user experience. These include:
    -   **Celery:** Comic Generation usually takes more than 30 secs, which can leads to 502 Gateway error, so we've implemented Celery Worker by which the comic generation pipeline will be executed on server.
    -   **Redis** It is used as Broker & Caching Database to boost the performance & also used in developing flask api for showing comic progress on fronted (Loading Page)
    -   **Intel Developer Cloud:** Leveraging Intel's high-performance CPU and XPU capabilities, we accelerated model training and inference processes, reducing processing time and improving overall performance. ‚ö°üíª

# How We Built It üõ†Ô∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 - User inputs a topic with story plot
 - The `Input Text` is then given to `Intel Mistral Optimised version` (Neural Chat)
 - `Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ Processors` with `Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX)`: Accelerated training and inference for text-to-image generation models using AMX-optimized matrix operations, enabling faster and more efficient comic panel creation.
 - `Intel OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ Toolkit`: Optimized our models for faster inference, integrated seamlessly with multiple AI frameworks, and ensured portability for deployment across various platforms.
 - `Red Hat OpenShift AI Environment`: Deployed and scaled our application in a secure, cloud-native infrastructure, leveraging Intel Xeon processors to streamline AI workloads and enhance development efficiency.
 - `Raw Comic Dialogues Text` is then parsed using `Post Processing functions` which `returns` the `result` in `JSON Format`
 - `For Generating Comic Poster`, a Dynamic Image Generation prompt is generated using Neural Chat by supplying comic topic.
 - `Dynamic Image prompt` is then `given to Image Generation Model` (Intel Optimized Stable Diffusion)
 - Similarly for generating comic scenes, a dynamic image prompt is generated using neuralchat by supplying Comic Scene Dialogue
 - Then that dynamically generated prompt is used to generate Comic scenes using Stable Diffusion
 - `Multithreading` is used for `parallel image & text generation`
 - Once Comic Images are generated, we `write` the `text on top of image` using `OpenCV` in `comic font`
 - Then Finally we merge the images using custom `Image List to PDF generator` code
 - `Celery worker` runs the above task & updates the `Redis db` for `saving` the `progress`
 - We have created a `Flask-Restful api` which is connected to redis for `fetching the progress`
 - `Loading page` calls this api `every 2 seconds` and shows the `progress` on the page
 - Onces the `api status is completed`, the page automatically `loads` the `Comic viewer`
 - `Comic viewer` has the functionality to either `read the comic on website itself` using `realistic page turn animation` & providing immersive comic reading experience
 - Also at the end of comic page, there is a option to `download` the `comic in PDF format`

## Use case of Intel¬Æ Developer Cloud (IDC)
- The platform utilizes Intel's Image Generation API hosted on IDC (`Intel Optimised Stable Diffusion`)
to transform the textual content into visually captivating comic panels
- The web application triggers the Intel Text Generation API hosted on IDC (`Intel's Neural-Chat`) to generate story script based on inputs.
